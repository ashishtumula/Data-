    "### 2.0 Introduction\n",
    "The first step in any machine learning endeavor is to get the raw data into our system. The raw data might be a logfile, dataset file, or database. Furthermore, often we will want to retrieve data from multiple sources. The recipies in this chapter look at methods of loading data from a variety of sources, including CSV files and SQL databases. We also cover methods of generating simulated data with desirable properties for experimentation. Finally, while there are many ways to load data in the Python ecosystem, we will focus on using the pandas library's extensive set of methods for loading external data, and using scikit-learn--an open source machine learning library in Python--for generating simulated data.\n",

Luckily, scikit-learn comes with some common datasets we can quickly load. These datasets are often called \"toy\" datasets because they are far smaller and cleaner than a dataset we would see in the real world. Some popular sample datasets in scikit-learn are:\n",
